# üìò Iteration Spec ‚Äì Document Q&A App (LangChain + Next.js)

---

## üè∑ Overview

This project is a web app where users can:

‚úÖ Upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT)  
‚úÖ Ask questions about uploaded content using ChatGPT (via LangChain)  
‚úÖ Preserve conversation memory across interactions  
‚úÖ Create and reuse "templates" (custom system prompts for different use cases)

The app is built entirely with **Next.js (frontend + API routes)**, using **LangChain** for document processing and **ChromaDB** (local) as the vector store.

## üöÄ Iteration Roadmap

---

### üå± **Iteration 1 ‚Äì MVP: Upload & Chat**

**Goal:**  
Enable uploading documents and chatting with memory (single user, no auth).

**Features:**

- [x] Document Upload API
  - POST `/api/upload`
  - Accept PDF, DOCX, TXT
  - Extract text and split into chunks
  - Generate embeddings (OpenAI)
  - Store vectors in ChromaDB (local)
- [x] Chat API
  - POST `/api/chat`
  - Accept user message
  - Retrieve relevant document chunks via vector search
  - Combine retrieved context with LangChain conversation memory
  - Respond with GPT-generated answer
- [x] Frontend UI
  - Upload form
  - Simple chat interface with streaming responses

**Outcome:**  
Single user can upload a doc and ask questions in a session with memory.

### üåø **Iteration 2 ‚Äì Templates**

**Goal:**  
Allow users to create and manage reusable prompt templates.

**Features:**

- [] Templates API
  - GET `/api/templates` ‚Äì List templates

  - Templates include:
    - Template name
    - System prompt
    - Config (e.g., chunk size, model)
- [] Frontend UI
  - Template management page
  - Select a template before starting a chat
- [] Templates stored in memory (or JSON file for now)

- [x] Frontend UI
  - URL input form for web scraping
  - Progress indicators for scraping operations
  - Display scraped content preview
  - Option to combine web content with uploaded documents
- [x] Enhanced Chat
  - Query across both uploaded documents and scraped web content
  - Source attribution for web content responses
  - Filter responses by content type (documents vs web)

**Outcome:**  
Users can scrape web content and chat about it alongside their uploaded documents.

---

### üóÑÔ∏è **Iteration 6 ‚Äì Database Query**

**Goal:**  
Enable users to query databases directly and use LLM to answer questions about the data.

**Features:**

  - Return structured results with metadata
- [] Database Schema Analysis
  - GET `/api/db/schema` ‚Äì Retrieve database schema
  - Table and column information
  - Foreign key relationships
  - Data types and constraints
- [] Frontend UI
  - Separate database query page (`/db-query`)
  - Database connection form
  - Table selection interface (multi-select)
  - Natural language query input
  - Results display with data visualization
  - Query history and saved queries
  - Schema browser/explorer
- [] Enhanced LLM Integration
  - Use selected table schemas as context for query generation
  - Limit query scope to selected tables only
  - Explain query results in natural language
  - Suggest follow-up questions based on data
  - Generate insights and patterns from query results
- [] Security & Safety
